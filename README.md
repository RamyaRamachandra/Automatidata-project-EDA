# Automatidata-project-EDA
You are the newest data professional in a fictional data consulting firm: Automatidata. The team is still early into the project, having only just completed an initial plan of action and some early Python coding work.

Luana Rodriquez, the senior data analyst at Automatidata, is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with some EDA and data visualization work for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission project (New York City TLC) to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership looks like. The management team is asking for a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. For this taxi data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a New York City map of taxi/limo trips by month. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isnâ€™t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director at the New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

#### Course 3 End-of-course project: Exploratory data analysis
In this activity, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. You will also design a professional data visualization that tells a story, and will help data-driven decisions for business needs.

Please note that the Tableau visualization activity is optional, and will not affect your completion of the course. Completing the Tableau activity will help you practice planning out and plotting a data visualization based on a specific business need. The structure of this activity is designed to emulate the proposals you will likely be assigned in your career as a data professional. Completing this activity will help prepare you for those career moments.

***The purpose*** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation you began in C2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables.

The goal is to clean data set and create a visualization.

This activity has 4 parts:

**Part 1**: Imports, links, and loading

**Part 2**: Data Exploration

* Data cleaning
**Part 3**: Building visualizations

**Part 4**: Evaluate and share results


Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
